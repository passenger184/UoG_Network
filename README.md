# UOG Network

Welcome to UOG Network â€“ a Django-based platform designed to foster collaboration among university students.

## Overview

UOG Network is a Django-based platform designed to foster collaboration among university students. 
The project addresses the challenge of a lack of a dedicated platform for students to connect, collaborate, and exchange ideas. 
I played a pivotal role in creating a comprehensive website that enhances the academic and social experience of students.

## Project Structure
